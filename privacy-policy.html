                  <p class="para-size mt-4">References to “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy are equivalent to “Personal Data” governed by European data protection legislation.</p>
                  <h3 class="ans-sub-heading mt-5 pt-5">B. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</h3>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● Where we need to perform obligations relating to a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Our legitimate interests include those related to conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. <br>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your Personal Information other than in relation to sending marketing communications to you via email. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us using the contact information provided above.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your Personal Information other than in relation to sending marketing communications to you via email. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us using the contact information provided above.</p>
                  <h3 class="ans-sub-heading mt-5 pt-5">C. CONTROLLER</h3>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of <a href="mailto:info@gamingtime.com" class="text-white">info@gamingtime.com</a>. <br>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us using the details set out below.</p>
                  <h3 class="ans-sub-heading mt-5 pt-5">D. DATA RETENTION</h3>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. <br>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data: see the Request Erasure subsection below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
                  <h3 class="ans-sub-heading mt-5 pt-5">E. CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h3>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis that allows us to do so. <br>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
                  <h3 class="ans-sub-heading mt-5 pt-5">F. EU RESIDENT PERSONAL DATA RIGHTS</h3>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">Under certain circumstances, EU Residents may have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data as outlined below:</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● REQUEST ACCESS to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● REQUEST CORRECTION of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● REQUEST ERASURE of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● OBJECT TO PROCESSING of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● OBJECT TO PROCESSING of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● REQUEST RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● REQUEST THE TRANSFER of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">● WITHDRAW CONSENT at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5">If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact <a style="color: #17E9E2; text-decoration:underline;" href="mailto:info@gamingtime.com">info@gamingtime.com.</a> <br>No Fee Usually Required <br>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
                  <div class="mt-5 pt-4"></div>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4 pt-5"><b>What We May Need From You</b></p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5 pt-3"><b>Time Limit To Respond</b></p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-5 pt-3"><b>Complaints to Supervisory Authority</b></p>
                  <p class="para-size mt-4">EU Residents may have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues. However, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so please first contact us directly to allow us to do so.</p>
